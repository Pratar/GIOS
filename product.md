# GIOS Quality & Reliability Enhancement Plan

> Goal: bring GIOS to a production-grade, auditable standard by closing calibration, fairness, drift, stability, and structural-robustness gaps; strengthen release gates, dashboards, and ops playbooks.

---

## 0) Kickoff & Alignment (Week 0)
**Outcomes**
- Shared definitions for “quality”, “readability cost”, “release gate”, “criticality levels”.
- Owners, RACI, and success criteria agreed.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Approve roles: Lead Architect, ML Engineer, Data Analyst, Platform/SRE.
- [ ] Confirm target domains, datasets, environments (dev/stage/prod).
- [ ] Lock glossary & metric dictionary.

**Deliverables**
- Charter (scope, risks, KPIs), RACI, glossary.

---

## 1) Baseline & Instrumentation (Weeks 1–2)
**Outcomes**
- A single source of truth for metrics and events across SAFE/RUN/RECOVER loops.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Inventory current metrics (AUC/ROC/PR, accuracy, latency, costs, etc.).
- [ ] Instrument metric streaming (e.g., OpenTelemetry + time-series store).
- [ ] Tag every metric with: room/context, role, model/version, data slice.

**Deliverables**
- Metrics inventory, metric schemas, dashboards v0.
- Reproducible baseline report (current performance/variance).

**DoD**
- All services emit versioned metrics with context tags; baseline report published.

---

## 2) Probability Calibration & Quality Gates (Weeks 3–4)
**Outcomes**
- Well-calibrated probabilities; release gates enforce calibration.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Add post-hoc calibration (temperature scaling / isotonic) per model & slice.
- [ ] Compute ECE/MCE and reliability diagrams in CI.
- [ ] Extend release gates: `ECE ≤ T_cal` (default recommendation: 0.02–0.03).
- [ ] Include calibration utility in overall quality score.

**Deliverables**
- Calibration module, CI checks, reliability dashboards.

**DoD**
- Models cannot pass to stage/prod unless calibration thresholds are met.

---

## 3) Fairness & Bias Controls (Weeks 4–6)
**Outcomes**
- Measurable, enforced fairness across roles, rooms/contexts, and key cohorts.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Define slices (by role, room/context, class labels, regions).
- [ ] Choose bias metrics (e.g., ΔTPR/ΔFPR, demographic parity diff, equalized odds).
- [ ] Set per-slice thresholds; add to release gates and runtime monitors.
- [ ] Add bias explanations to model cards.

**Deliverables**
- Fairness policy, slice specs, CI checks, bias dashboards, model card template.

**DoD**
- No release if any protected slice breaches bias thresholds; alerts wired in prod.

---

## 4) Drift & Anomaly Handling Linked to SAFE/RUN/RECOVER (Weeks 6–8)
**Outcomes**
- Automated transitions to SAFE and controlled RECOVER procedures on drift.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Implement drift detectors (data drift: PSI/KL; concept drift: DDM/ADWIN).
- [ ] Define criticality levels (info/warn/critical) and corresponding actions.
- [ ] Bind critical drift to SAFE mode; require RECOVER checklist and sign-off.
- [ ] Add canary and rollback tests to the release pipeline.

**Deliverables**
- Drift playbook, criticality matrix, SAFE/RECOVER runbooks, synthetic drift tests.

**DoD**
- Any critical drift triggers SAFE automatically; RECOVER requires passing gates.

---

## 5) Stability & Crisis SLOs (Weeks 7–9)
**Outcomes**
- Quantified system stability and bounded crisis probability.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Define stability score (e.g., variance of key KPIs under realistic perturbations).
- [ ] Estimate crisis probability under stress scenarios (fault injection, load spikes).
- [ ] Set SLOs: `Stability ≥ T_stab`, `CrisisProb ≤ T_cr`.
- [ ] Add resilience tests to CI (chaos/load/cost spikes).

**Deliverables**
- Stability model, crisis estimator, resilience test suite, SLO dashboards.

**DoD**
- Releases must pass stability/crisis SLOs and resilience tests.

---

## 6) Structural Robustness (“Weak Link”) & Contradiction Monitoring (Weeks 8–10)
**Outcomes**
- Measured “weakest component” and tracked structural contradictions.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Define system utility by component; compute `min_component_score` as the weak link.
- [ ] Track contradiction/consistency indicators across modules and interfaces.
- [ ] Optimize release decisions by minimax criterion (lift the weakest component).

**Deliverables**
- Weak-link metric, contradiction report, prioritization rules.

**DoD**
- Releases require `weak_link ≥ T_min`; contradictions logged and triaged.

---

## 7) Decision Trade-off Dashboard (Weeks 9–11)
**Outcomes**
- Clear view of success vs. risk vs. entropy/uncertainty vs. cost vs. readability.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Create composite utility with weights for: predictive quality, risk, entropy, cost, readability.
- [ ] Provide “what-if” sliders for gate thresholds and scenario toggles.
- [ ] Add provenance (data version, code hash, feature lineage).

**Deliverables**
- “Go/No-Go” dashboard for release boards; PDF export for audits.

**DoD**
- Every release uses the dashboard during Change Advisory Board (CAB) review.

---

## 8) Documentation, Model Cards & Training (Weeks 10–12)
**Outcomes**
- Repeatable operations and transparent audits.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Standardize model cards (purpose, data, calibration, fairness, drift, SLOs, rollback).
- [ ] Update ops runbooks (SAFE/RUN/RECOVER, on-call, incident templates).
- [ ] Conduct trainings for dev, data, SRE, and governance.

**Deliverables**
- Model card library, updated runbooks, training recordings & quizzes.

**DoD**
- 90%+ staff pass the knowledge check; docs versioned and searchable.

---

## 9) Rollout & Continuous Improvement (Weeks 12–14 and ongoing)
**Outcomes**
- Production adoption with feedback loop.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Stage → canary → prod rollout with guardrails.
- [ ] Weekly retros on gate violations and incidents.
- [ ] Quarterly threshold recalibration and metric refresh.

**Deliverables**
- Release notes, incident register, quarterly quality review.

**DoD**
- Sustained compliance with gates; decreasing trend in incidents and rollbacks.

---

## Success Criteria (initial recommendations)
- **Calibration:** ECE ≤ 0.02 (per model and per key slice).
- **Fairness:** ΔTPR/ΔFPR ≤ 5% across protected slices (domain-specific).
- **Drift:** Automatic SAFE on critical drift; mean time to RECOVER ≤ agreed SLO.
- **Stability:** Stability score ≥ target under stress; zero Sev-1 incidents post-release.
- **Weak Link:** Minimum component score ≥ threshold (no hidden bottlenecks).
- **Readability/Cost:** Documented readability score meets policy; cost within budget.

---

## Governance & RACI
- **Lead Architect:** scope, thresholds, gate policy, final “Go/No-Go”.
- **ML Engineer:** calibration/fairness modules, drift detectors, tests.
- **Data Analyst:** slicing strategy, metric validation, dashboards.
- **Platform/SRE:** telemetry, CI/CD gates, SAFE/RECOVER automation, SLOs.
- **Stakeholders (PM/Compliance):** accept thresholds, audit readiness.

---

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Noisy metrics or sparse slices:** aggregate windows, hierarchical slicing, bootstrap CI.
- **False-positive drift alerts:** combine detectors, require multi-signal confirmation.
- **Gate friction slowing releases:** parallelize gates, cache artifacts, fast canaries.
- **Threshold misalignment:** quarterly governance reviews; maintain “override with justification” protocol.

---

- [ ] Metric dictionary & schemas  
- [ ] Gate policy (YAML) and CI checks  
- [ ] Calibration module + reliability reports  
- [ ] Fairness slices & thresholds + dashboards  
- [ ] Drift detectors + criticality matrix + runbooks

## Definition of Done (program level)
- All releases are blocked by quality gates (calibration, fairness, drift, stability, weak-link).  
- SAFE/RECOVER is automatic and auditable.  
- Dashboards and model cards enable transparent, repeatable decisions.  
- Incidents decline, rollbacks rare, and quality KPIs trend upward quarter-over-quarter.
